# Background
background-color image
background-size: cover, contain
background-repeat
background-position //cropping for x and y
background-origin //background positioning area
background-clip //background extends underneath border?

*Setting a bg image*
background-color //act as a fallback
background-image: url()
background-size: cover
// try not to set a height, instead use padding top and bottom

- cannot change opacity of bg image instead: background-blend-mode: multiply | lighten
- this blends the bg color with the image

# background-repeat: space
- repeats image but contains and evenly spaces it

# Gradient
gradients are treated as images

linear-gradient()
radial-gradient()

# Shadows
box-shadow
