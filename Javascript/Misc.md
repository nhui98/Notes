# Proxy API
- wrapper around an object, that forwards operations on it to the object, optionally trapping some of them.
let proxy = new Proxy(target, {
  /* traps */
});

We can trap:
- Reading (get), writing (set), deleting (deleteProperty) a property (even a non-existing one).
- Calling a function (apply trap).
- The new operator (construct trap).
